Note: if youâ€™d like to implement a new feature, please consider creating a feature request issue first to start a discussion about the feature.

## Code Guidelines

### Ansible Guidelines

*   Run `molecule lint` over your code to automatically resolve a lot of `yaml` and Ansible style issues.
*   Run `molecule test --all` on your code before you submit a PR to catch any potential issues.
*   Follow these guides on some good practices for Ansible:
    *   <https://www.ansible.com/blog/ansible-best-practices-essentials>
    *   <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html>

### Git Guidelines

*   Keep a clean, concise and meaningful git commit history on your branch (within reason), rebasing locally and squashing before submitting a PR
*   Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described here <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/> and summarised in the next few points
    *   In the subject line, use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
    *   In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
    *   Limit the subject line to 72 characters or less
    *   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line
    *   Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (`git commit -a` to give you more space and time in your text editor to write a good message instead of `git commit -am`)
