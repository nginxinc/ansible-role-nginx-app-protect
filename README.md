# NGINX App Protect WAF and DoS Ansible Role <img src="images/nap-logo.png" width="30">

This role installs and configures NGINX App Protect WAF or DoS for NGINX Plus on your target host.

**Note:** By default, this role will install NGINX App Protect WAF. To install NGINX App Protect DoS, you need to set the `nginx_app_protect_dos_enable` variable to `true`.

**Note:** This role is still in active development. There may be unidentified issues and the role variables may change as development continues.

## Requirements

### NGINX App Protect

If you wish to install NGINX App Protect WAF or NGINX App Protect DoS using this role, you will need to obtain the corresponding NGINX App Protect license beforehand.

### Ansible

* This role is developed and tested with [maintained](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html) versions of Ansible core (above `2.11`).
* When using Ansible core, you will also need to install the following collections:

    ```yaml
    ---
    collections:
      - name: community.general
        version: 4.4.0
      - name: ansible.posix
        version: 1.3.0
      - name: community.docker  # Only required if you plan to use Molecule (see below)
        version: 2.1.1
    ```

    **Note:** You can alternatively install the Ansible community distribution (what is known as the "old" Ansible) if you don't want to manage individual collections.
* Instructions on how to install Ansible can be found in the [Ansible website](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#upgrading-ansible-from-version-2-9-and-older-to-version-2-10-or-later).

### Jinja2

* This role uses Jinja2 templates. Ansible core installs Jinja2 by default, but depending on your install and/or upgrade path, you might be running an outdated version of Jinja2. The minimum version of Jinja2 required for the role to properly function is `2.11`.
* Instructions on how to install Jinja2 can be found in the [Jinja2 website](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/intro/#installation).

### Molecule (Optional)

* Molecule is used to test the various functionalities of the role. The recommended version of Molecule to test this role is `3.3`.
* Instructions on how to install Molecule can be found in the [Molecule website](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). *You will also need to install the Molecule Docker driver.*
* To run the Molecule tests, you must copy your NGINX App Protect license to the role's [`files/license`](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-app-protect/blob/main/files/license/) folder.

You can alternatively add your NGINX App Protect repository certificate and key to the local environment. Run the following commands to export these files as base64-encoded variables and execute the Molecule tests:

```bash
export NGINX_CRT=$( cat <path to your certificate file> | base64 )
export NGINX_KEY=$( cat <path to your key file> | base64 )
molecule test
```

## Installation

### Ansible Galaxy

Use `ansible-galaxy install nginxinc.nginx_app_protect` to install the latest stable release of the role on your system.

### Git

Use `git clone https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-app-protect.git` to pull the latest edge commit of the role from GitHub.

## Platforms

### NGINX App Protect WAF

The NGINX App Protect Ansible role supports all platforms supported by [NGINX Plus](https://www.nginx.com/products/technical-specs/) that intersect with the following list of distributions of App Protect WAF:

```yaml

Debian:
  - buster (10)
RHEL:
  - 7.4+
Ubuntu:
  - bionic (18.04)

**Note:** Due to a packaging limitation in NGINX App Protect on Alpine, it may be required to explicitly install NGINX Plus on the instance **before** using the NGINX App Protect role if a hotfix version of NGINX Plus has been published. It is recommended to use the [NGINX Core](https://galaxy.ansible.com/nginxinc/nginx_core) Ansible role for this purpose.
